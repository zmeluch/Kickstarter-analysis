# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
To help Louise with her kickstarter fundraising for her new play, a large data set of kickstarter campaigns was analyzed and visualized. The data was filtered to the parent category Theater and the subcategory plays to give Louise and more specific anaylsis. And visualizations for outcomes based on launch date and based on fundraising goal were created.

### Purpose
This analysis should help Louise by giving her an idea of how successful other campaigns were that were similiar to hers. It should also show her when the best time to launch her campaign would be. It will also give her the an idea if her fudraising goal needs to be adjusted to give it a better chance to be successful.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The only difficulty faced was inserting the countifs formulas for the Outcomes Based on Goal Chart, The misspelling of failed in on cell in particular caused issue. Through patient review the problem was found and corrected. The another challenge that could be faced is in the pivot table for the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date chart. Getting months on the chart instead of years could provide some difficulty.
